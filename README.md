## Introduction

This Project was developed for my third year RDaC (Robotic Design and Construction) module at the University of York. I is based off the Arduino Nano BLE 33 and the ARB Board.

The project is a robot that can autonomously navigate a maze and find a target. The robot is to be controlled by RTOS (Real Time Operating System) and is to be programmed in C++ using Mbed libraries.

I have named the robot BATFINK, which stands for **B**atfink **A**utonomous **T**arget **F**inding **I**ntelligent **N**avigation **K**inetic bot also as it uses ultrasonic sensors to navigate and find a target just as the 90s cartoon character Batfink would (SUPER SONIC SONAR RADAR).

## Hardware

TBD - Unfortunatly, I am running out of time to do the project therefore this doc will be neglected for a while.

## Software

TBD - see above
