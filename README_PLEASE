Hi Mark,

There are some things to note:

inside this zip there are a few files that need a little explaining

- Python - contains all of the scripts like the BLE controller and Mapping / Solver aswell as a dataplotter.

- batfink - Robot Code

- CAD drawings - anotated drawings + CAD models for all parts used!

Many Thanks!

Jack
