# Reafctoring plan

- [ ] Rewrite motor control lib to be more thread friendly, make sure its non blocking and works as planned
- [ ] Rewrite BLE so that simple flags can be set (stop / start, mode etc).
- [ ] Rewrite Sensor reading lib to be more thread friendly, make sure its non blocking and works as planned
- [ ] Write PID controller
- [ ] Look into mapping algorithms - how can i store the map on the robot? How can i make it more efficient?
- [ ] Look into path planning algorithms - how can i make it more efficient?

This all needs to be done on thursday, its going to be a very busy day.
